<h4>OOP Principle	Where It’s Used</h4>

Encapsulation - 	Private members like balance and pin

Abstraction - 	Abstract base class Account with pure virtual methods

Inheritance - 	SavingsAccount inherits from Account

Polymorphism - 	Virtual methods and base class pointers

Friend Function - 	checkBalance() accesses private member balance

Operator Overloading - 	operator>> for transferring funds between accounts

Destructor - 	Cleans up account data on program exit
